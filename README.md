# Mega Consolidation Plan – FY 2025

Capacity, cube movement, and transfer analysis for mega consolidation planning across entities for FY 2025

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard provides a detailed view of the **Mega Consolidation Plan for FY 2025**, focusing on **capacity availability, transfer-out and transfer-in cube movements (CFT), and variance analysis** across multiple entities and locations.  
Built using **Looker Studio**, the dashboard helps operations and planning teams track **planned vs actual movements**, identify **capacity deficits**, and monitor **consolidation progress against timelines**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Track **available capacity (CFT & Box)** across entities  
- Monitor **transfer-out and transfer-in cube movements**  
- Compare **planned vs actual CFT movement**  
- Identify **capacity surplus and deficit areas**  
- Enable **entity-wise and activity-wise consolidation analysis**  
- Support planning decisions for **FY 2025 consolidation timelines**

## 📌 KPI Questions Answered

- What is the **total available capacity (CFT)** across entities?  
- How much **CFT is planned vs actually moved**?  
- What is the **pending CFT** yet to be consolidated?  
- Which entities have **capacity surplus or deficits**?  
- How does **current cube movement compare with expected movement**?  
- What is the **entity-wise transfer-out and transfer-in distribution**?  
- Are consolidation targets achievable within the defined timeline?

## 📈 Key Metrics & Calculations

- **Available Capacity (CFT & Box)**  
- **Total Transfer Out CFT (TO)**  
- **Total Transfer In CFT (TI)**  
- **CFT Pending** = Planned CFT − Moved CFT  
- **Expected Cube Movement vs Current Cube Movement**  
- **Variance / Deficit to Cover**  
- **Movement %** = (Moved CFT ÷ Total CFT) × 100  

---

## 📊 Analysis Dimensions

- Activity-wise consolidation summary  
- Entity-wise capacity distribution  
- Transfer-Out vs Transfer-In comparison  
- BAU vs consolidation movement  
- Object / code-level cube distribution  
- Timeline-based movement tracking (target date: 30th Sep 2025)

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Significant **pending CFT** indicates consolidation backlog across entities  
- Certain entities show **high movement efficiency**, while others lag significantly  
- **Capacity mismatch** identified through surplus and deficit analysis  
- Transfer-out volume distribution highlights **concentration risk** in select entities  
- Variance between **expected and current cube movement** flags execution gaps  
- Entity-level drill-down enables **prioritization of critical consolidation locations**

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This dashboard delivers a centralized view of the **Mega Consolidation Plan for FY 2025**, enabling proactive monitoring of capacity utilization and cube movement. By combining transfer planning with real-time movement tracking, it supports **risk identification, capacity optimization, and execution alignment** across entities, ensuring consolidation targets are met within planned timelines.
